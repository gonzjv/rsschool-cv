**About** 🏂

My main goal is life like nature meant. Easier to say:

- do things you like to do;
- help your loved ones, friends, humans, animals;
- not restrict the freedom of others;
- perceive information with a healthy criticism.

In work and personal life: _persistent_, _patient_, _calm_ and a _little kind_.

Since finishing studies at BNTU (Minsk, 2012) was employed as elictrical engineer in mining equipment company Niva (Soligorsk). After three years here, I moved to JSC Belaruskali to a more interesting position: automated systems engineer.
